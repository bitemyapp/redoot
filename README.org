* Redoot
The Reddit bot that gets you to buy crap from Woot!

** Execution
python ./redoot.py

** What's interesting about this?

Rather than naively posting whatever is on woot directly to the
subreddit as a submission, it treats it as a synchronization
problem. It tracks what has already been posted by checking the posts
on the subreddit to see if it'd already posted something.

I plan to change this synchronization tactic to a sqlite database
soon.
